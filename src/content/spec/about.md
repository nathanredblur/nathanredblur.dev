# Beyond Code

I'm endlessly curious and love experimenting with software, hardware, and learning about new things. This page is a glimpse into who I am when I'm not writing code.

## Music

My taste in music is all over the place — I enjoy everything from electronic and synthwave to rock, alternative, and video game soundtracks. Some artists/bands I keep coming back to:

- **Daft Punk** — Pioneers of electronic music. *Discovery* is a masterpiece.
- **Yoko Kanno** — Her work with The Seatbelts on Cowboy Bebop is legendary, and her anime OSTs in general are incredible.
- **Radiohead** — Always pushing boundaries.
- **The Killers** — Rock anthems that never get old.
- **Tame Impala** — Psychedelic rock meets electronic production.
- **Nujabes** — The godfather of lo-fi hip hop.

I also have a deep appreciation for video game soundtracks — games like Hyper Light Drifter and Bastion have music that stands on its own as great art.

If you have a band or artist to share, hit me up!

## Gaming

I'm a lifelong gamer with a soft spot for indie titles that experiment with unique mechanics and art styles. I gravitate toward **platformers, puzzle games, and hidden object adventures**.

- **Hollow Knight** — Metroidvania perfection. The atmosphere, art, and challenge are incredible.
- **Hyper Light Drifter** — Challenging gameplay with an absolutely stunning soundtrack.
- **Ori and the Blind Forest / Will of the Wisps** — Visually breathtaking platformers.
- **Bastion** — Great music, great story, great gameplay.
- **Dead Cells** — Roguelike with tight combat that keeps me coming back.

- **Fez** — Addictive and clever puzzle platformer.
- **It Takes Two** — The perfect co-op experience to play with your partner.
- **Abzu & Journey** — Games that soothe the soul with their beautiful landscapes and atmosphere.

...and many others. Always open to recommendations!

### Platforms

For Nintendo exclusives like **Mario Kart** and **Zelda**, I play on the **Switch**. For everything else, I prefer **Steam** — I love the versatility of PC gaming and the indie scene there.

## Aesthetics & Interests

I have a deep appreciation for **Y2K and retro-futuristic aesthetics** — that early 2000s tech optimism with its translucent plastics, vibrant colors, and bold design choices. There's something nostalgic yet forward-looking about that era.

I'm also fascinated by:

- **Mechanical keyboards** — Currently using a custom build.
- **UI/UX design** — Clean interfaces and thoughtful interactions.
- **Productivity tools** — Always optimizing my workflow.
- **Coffee** — Essential fuel for coding sessions.

## My Setup

I work on a **Mac mini M1** and **MacBook Pro M4**, using **Cursor** as my main editor with **Claude** as my AI assistant. I'm a macOS power user who loves CLI tools and automation.
