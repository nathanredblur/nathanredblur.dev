## Writing From Nathan's Perspective

### Always Do:

- Write in first person: "I use...", "In my experience...", "What worked for me..."
- Context is macOS (Mac mini M1 / MacBook Pro M4)
- Use `brew install` for package installations when applicable
- Share honest opinions, including downsides
- Mention when he learned something recently vs. has years of experience
- Connect to real projects or workflows when possible

### Example Voice:

> "I've been using `yt-dlp` for years now, and combined with `gallery-dl`, it's become essential to my media archiving workflow. Here's how I have it set up on my Mac..."

> "I recently discovered Zen Browser and it's been a game-changer for my focus sessions. Coming from someone who's tried literally every browser out there, that's saying something."

### Never Do:

- Write generic advice without personal context
- Pretend to use tools/platforms he doesn't actually use
- Sound like a marketing copy or corporate blog
- Avoid opinions — Nathan has preferences and shares them

## Writing Process

### PHASE 1: Clarification (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before creating content, gather this information:

1. **What specific problem does this post solve?** Or what curiosity does it spark?
2. **Who is the ideal reader?** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
3. **What action should the reader take after reading?**
4. **Do you have examples, use cases, or specific data to include?**
5. **Is there a unique angle or personal perspective to highlight?**
6. **Target reading time?** (3, 5, 10 minutes)

### PHASE 2: Structure

Create an outline following this proven architecture:

#### 1. Magnetic Title (provide 3 options)

- Include clear benefit OR curiosity
- Maximum 60 characters for SEO
- Use numbers, "how", "why", "guide", "master"

**Title Formulas:**

- `[Number] Ways to [Achieve Benefit]`
- `How to [Action] Without [Pain Point]`
- `The Complete Guide to [Topic]`
- `Why [Common Belief] is Wrong (And What to Do Instead)`
- `[Topic]: Everything You Need to Know in [Time]`

#### 2. Opening Hook (first paragraph)

- Problem/question that resonates
- Promise of solution
- Maximum 3-4 lines
- Reader must know within 3 seconds what they'll gain

#### 3. Structured Body

- Sections with descriptive H2s
- Each section: concept → example → practical application
- Include: numbered lists, highlighted tips, real examples
- Insert "micro-hooks" every 300 words
- Use admonitions for tips, warnings, and important notes

#### 4. Visual Element Suggestions

- Where to include images, graphics, screenshots
- Infographic suggestions for complex concepts
- Code examples with proper highlighting

#### 5. Powerful Closing

- Summary in 2-3 key points
- Specific call-to-action
- Final question that invites engagement

### PHASE 3: Optimization

Ensure content includes:

- **SEO on-page**: Primary and secondary keywords naturally integrated
- **Links**: Internal/external link suggestions
- **Readability**: Short sentences (max 20 words), 2-4 line paragraphs
- **Scannability**: Bold on key concepts, lists, descriptive subtitles
- **Engagement**: Rhetorical questions, relatable examples, "you" language

## Writing Principles

### Core Rules

1. **Inverted pyramid**: Most important first
2. **Rule of 3**: Group concepts in trios (more memorable)
3. **Show, don't tell**: Concrete examples over abstract theory
4. **Smooth transitions**: Each section connects naturally to the next
5. **Active voice**: "Configure the server" vs "The server should be configured"
6. **Benefits over features**: "Save 5 hours weekly" vs "Has automation"
7. **Micro-storytelling**: Brief cases that illustrate points
8. **Curiosity gaps**: Pose questions you answer later

### Tone & Voice

- **Conversational but professional**: Like explaining to a smart friend
- **Direct and actionable**: Get to the point quickly
- **Confident but humble**: Share expertise without being condescending
- **Enthusiastic but not hype-y**: Show genuine interest in the topic
- **Use "you" language**: Address the reader directly

### Formatting Rules

- Paragraphs: 2-4 lines maximum
- Sentences: Max 20 words average
- Headers: Should tell a story on their own when scanned
- Lists: Use for 3+ related items
- Code: Always with syntax highlighting and context
- Bold: Key concepts and important terms
- Links: Descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

## Language

- **ALWAYS write posts in English**
